Ok Hello this is Paul Bean, Previous Owner Of Godwars: The Midnight Dreams
By reading this means you have downloaded/leeched/stolen this code.
This aint no hardcore license or copyright but anyways. By using My code
and it deriving from a c program written on linux made by Kavir. You may
in no way Copyright, Charge, Or withold it. This code was made by the 
players for the players. If you know anything about linux and everything
made for it or derived its FREE and OPEN FOR DISTRIBUTION. Fucking diku
and fucking Kavir and them have no humanly write to copyright or pull 
the bullshit they do. I do give props to listy for making the classes
however I hate there fight code and hope it burns in hell for all 
eternity and anyways youll read about that on the warning file. Ok now
What I ask is to post in a Help file called shoutout.
0 SHOUTOUT~
This code is used off of the modified godwars code MIDNIGHT DREAMS.
This mud would not be possible with them or from the man who created
Linux. He makes this a free thing and a lovely thing at that. respect 
it.

SHOUTOUT TO THE ADMINS BREETAI NEKA AND SMOO
They Were The best and helped me through alot. Especially Neka The
Greatest friend I could Have. 
Big Big Thanks to Neka, Shes helped me through a big time in my life and 
I love her to death. Shes the greatest friend I have.
Special Thanks to Smoo and Goliath who did all the debugging and rewrote
and fixed all the classes your using today. Plus all the wiz commands,
Oldie exp, exp system, who system, class system, detox, and more. This
code wasnt even finished with mset. SHOTOUT IS ALL BECAUSE OF THOSE 2 
MEN.

Id not like to thank the diku and godwars team well I will but they had
no write to copyright code. It was written to be used on a Linux/Unix
based system and IT IS, LINUX AND EVERYTHING MADE FOR IT IS SUPPOST TO
BE FREE AND WELCOMED MODIFICATION FOR ALL OF IT WAS WELCOMED.
I hope you people remember that some day when you program yourself.

Anyways this was written by Paul Bean Jr.(AKA Bryantos)

If I dont see that I will do some major bitching and you will not be
happy, its my code I know all about it. Shape Shifters, Golems, 
Gummy bears, and berserkers Were Customized ORIGINAL classes designed
by me and smoo. They cannot be falsified you cant say you invented it
because if you do your full of shit anyways we ask for one helpfile.
Thats all come on please people dont try to steal this theres nothing
to steal its all free.

heh ok first of all, gummy bears aren't classes..they just have a slightly
bugged mob spec, so I disabled the mob spec..anyways I don't know why
bryantos gave any recognition to goliath because all he did was disable my
shit for no reason and bitch at me for doing stuff the players wanted and
I saw that it was needed.

Anyways, I just ask that you give me some recognition for my coding, all
the stuff I made was created from scratch by me, I don't use any snippets
or any shit like that. If you have any problems that you REALLY can't fix
yourselves, email me at smoo@junctionnet or my icq # is 14574324. I may
also be on dalnet on #SmooSoft, although I quit mudding so don't ask me to
log on to your mud.

All I'm asking you to do is give me recognition and don't steal my classes
by claiming them as your own. I did however get the idea for the
shapeshifter class off of a rot class called dopplegangers(wierd ass name
if you ask me) although it didn't turn out hardly the same at all.
