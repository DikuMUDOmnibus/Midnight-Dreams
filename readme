Ok This is a Godwars Codebase. It comes with everything a coder could want
and more. Be sure to read class.c over very carefully and understand how
it works. To startup the mud do a make in the src directory and it
will compile. Next when your ready Add your names into the command
do_relevel in kav_wiz.c then do ./startup portnumber& - log on
with the name you had set in relevel and type relevel. HAVE FUN AND
REMEMBER TO READ LICENSE!.

-please read smoo's thingy in license. the license is modified from the
original release because bryantos didn't give me a chance to say anything
and all he did was provide the server, me(Smoo) and jace did all the work
on the mud, with some help from berelain and bryantos, although they
started to code shortly before the mud went down.-
