0 NEWMAGE NEWMAGES APPRENTICE~
New mages often have a daunting task of understanding how spell 
writing works.  There are several things you will need to do first.  
Practice the spells major creation, resistance, spellproof, insert page,
remove page.  These are necessary for creating spells.

While experiencing, you will want to learn the spheres first.  
See help spheres and help <sphere_name> for more information.  
Spells created with runes cost no mana.  If you are a new mage ask 
another mage to make you a healing spell with runes.  It will help you 
greatly as you gain experience in the early stages of your character's 
life.

Basic book and page information:
c major rune mastery - creates a rune of mastery 
c major book - creates a book
c major pen - creates a pen
c major page - creates a page
c resistance page
c spellproof page
c copy rune page
c 'insert page' book
c 'remove page' <book_name>
turn book <forward/backward/page#>
chant <target>

Make sure to spellproof and resistance all pages and books.  

See also help files on mage, spheres, <sphere_name>, 
help runes, newmage2, spellwriting, examplespells.
~

0 NEWMAGE2~
If you can't create runes of mastery ask another mage to make some 
for you.  
To begin writing spells you must first c major page to create a page.
Copy a rune of mastery to the page.  Then spellproof and resistance 
the page.  
Hold your pen in either hand.  You are now ready to begin writing spells.
If you mess up on the spell, simply drop and sac the page.  Start again.
Be patient as learning to write spells takes time.

Each page starts with a title: write page title <title>
Then follows the body of the spell: write page line <line>
Spells may have only a few lines or several lines.  
Chain spells will have this line next to last: write page line next.page
Each spell ends with: write page line end.spell.

See also help files on: spellwriting, examplespells.

0 SPELLWRITING SPELLS~
Here is the basic format for spellwriting:

A.  page title

        *or*
    area.affect

E.  reversed (Reverses spell effect-makes damage spell heal)
F.  variables - (See also help variables)
    min.damage: <minimum amt of damage to inflict>
    max.damage: <maximum amt of damage to inflict>
G.  messages  (What is seen when you cast the spell)
    Keep the messages short!
    
    damage spells:
    message.1 = damage type (blast, fireball, lightning bolt, etc).
    message.2 = message to caster.
    message.3 = message to everyone else in the room
    
    affect spells
    message.1 = message to caster.
    message.2 = message to victim.
    message.3 = message to everyone else
    
    action spells
    message.1 = message to victim
    message.2 = message to those in original room
    message.3 = message to caster's room
    
    $n for your name
    $e for he or she
    $s for his or her
    $m for him or her
    $p for objects
    $N for target name
    $E for target (he/she)

~

0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

See also help on 'stance' and 'stancetable'.
~

0 AGE~
There are three Ages that can be trained each bestowing higher benefits then the one before

Ancillae - 2 million
Elder - 7.5 million
Methuselah - 15 million

Use the train command to see what age is available to you.
~

8 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
Syntax: ban     <site>
Syntax: ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.

battle. Men serve little purpose to Amazons other than for reproduction

Amazon Slaves are what have become a submissive order of men who,
for one reason or another, have ended up under the strick control
of the Amazon Women. Amazon Slaves are taught and trained in the
exact same style of combat as the Amazon Women. They in time also
begin to worship Artemis and as with the Amazon Women, Artemis
lends the slaves his blessing to aid them in combat. A Slave is
trained from the beginning to listen and obey the commands of
any and all Amazon Women, and do so or strick punishment will
be delt. An Amazon Slave can easily rival the strength of even the
best Amazon Woman, but only with obedience and the will to do so.

Amazon Slaves train the exact same powers as the Women, use the
#1help amazon#n file as reference.

The only unique skill to the Amazon Slave is their travel command
which is listed below.

Amazon Slaves are what have become a submissive order of men who,
for one reason or another, have ended up under the strick control
of the Amazon Women. Amazon Slaves are taught and trained in the
exact same style of combat as the Amazon Women. They in time also
begin to worship Artemis and as with the Amazon Women, Artemis
lends the slaves his blessing to aid them in combat. A Slave is
trained from the beginning to listen and obey the commands of
any and all Amazon Women, and do so or strick punishment will
be delt. An Amazon Slave can easily rival the strength of even the
best Amazon Woman, but only with obedience and the will to do so.

AT executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given

Syntax: chat     <message>
Syntax: music    <message>
Syntax: question <message>
Syntax: answer   <message>
Syntax: shout    <message>
Syntax: yell     <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

AUCTION, CHAT, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all
interested players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The QUESTION and ANSWER
commands both use the same 'question' channel

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.

0 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will 
hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
while you are grouped.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.

0 BEAST GOLCONDA FRENZY~
When a vampire's beast rating reaches 0 they are considered to have reached Golconda.  These vampires receive the 
benefits of very low blood costs for vampire abilities, higher parry/dodge, resistance to fire, and the ability to calm 
and use daywalker.  Once Golconda has been reached the song of SERENITY learned through the Animalism discipline may be 
used to calm a vampire of his rage, there allowing him regenerate quickly.  Daywalker allows him to travel by day and 
be unaffected by sunlight.  One reaches Golconda immediately (here) and only through divine intervention may they 
become Beast Vampires.
Beast vampires receive a frenzy bonus much higher than that of a normal vampire.  They pay for this with incredible 
blood upkeeps, and through they're lack of resistance to sunlight and fire.  A vampire raises his beast by starving 
himself and berserking on innocents, although once a Vampire reaches Golconda he cannot turn towards the beast.
Frenzy is also linked to Beast.  The higher your beast the more you frenzy benefits you.  Also while in a frenzy a 
vampire can regenerate lost body parts and slowly heal, although regenerating is a much faster way.

0 'CALL LIGHTNING'~
Syntax: cast 'call lightning'

This spell works only out of doors, and only when the weather is bad.
It calls down lightning bolts from God.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

0 DAMAGE~
When someone attacks someone else, a damage message is displayed to give 
you an idea of how much damage you have caused.  The following messages 
represent the following amounts of damage.

If you missed than you didn't hit your opponent.
If you hit with laughable force, then you've done 1-25 points of damage.
If you hit lightly, then you've done 26-50 points of damage.
If you hit, then you've done 51-100 points of damage.
If you hit hard, then you've done 101-250 points of damage.
If you hit very hard, then you've done 251-500 points of damage.
If you hit extremely hard, then you've done 501-750 points of damage.
If you hit insanely hard, then you've done 751-1000 points of damage.
If you hit amazingly hard, then you've done 1001-1250 points of damage.

~

0 DARKBLESSING~
Syntax: cast 'darkblessing' <name>

This spell infuses the target with demonic energy, improving their 
abilities in combat.
~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half of your 
current amount, so it's a good idea not to hoard exp.

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real
time). ~

0 DECAPITATE DECAP TEAR~
Do this to another avatar when they are mortally wounded, and you will 
suck out some of their lifeforce (represented by 1000exp), making them 
mortal again.  You may also loot their corpse, of course, and if you are 
hungry you can even eat their head ;)
Decapitation alone is not enough to completely destroy another avatar 
however, for their head will retain their remaining lifeforce.  To truely 
kill them, you must crack open their head and eat (or in some other way 
destroy) their brain.

Syntax: decap <victim>    Must wield a weapon.
Syntax: tear <victim>     For WW only.
~

0 DEMON DEMONS CHAMPION CHAMPIONS~
These fiends are the damned ones.  They have sold their souls in exchange 
for power, and they improve this power by draining the souls of their 
victims.  Their powers are mysterious, but the following facts are known:

* Each Champion, Demon, or Demon Prince follows a specific Demon Lord.  
  They are able to channel the souls of their victims to their Demon Lord, 
  who in turn can use that power to grant favours to his/her followers.
* Demonic armour improves the combat ability of the wearer, the more 
  armour worn the better the improvement.
* Many demons are able to transport themselves to each other at will.
* Most demons are able to assume the form of a weapon.
* The demons power over death is such that even after they have been 
  decapitated, they are still able to employ a selection of powers.
* The powers of a specific demon vary considerably.  Some are barely more 
  powerful than a common avatar, while others are as strong as the greatest 
  of werewolves or vampires.
* While in hell, a demon is virtually unkillable.

0 DISCIPLINE DISCIPLINES DISCS~
A vampire utilizes his blood in the arts known as Disciplines.  Through vigorous training, and at the cost of the lives 
of many innocents, a vampire gains strength.  To train a discipline type RESEARCH <Disc Name>.  Proceed then to destroy 
the life of many innocents (mobs).  You can check how much you have trained by typing DISC.  The status bar depicts how 
much of the discipline you have trained.  The more advanced disciplines (beyond 6) require that the souls of the 
powerful be contained within your body (status = every five points allows you to raise your discs by one more point)  
Of course the higher level discs take more of a payment in innocent life to obtain.  The disciplines available are:

Obtenebration : The Art of the Shadows
Presence : The ability of a Vampire to mesmerize crowds
Quietus : The Silent Art of Assassination
Thaumaturgy : The magic of vampire blood 
Auspex : A vampires supernormal senses
Dominate : The Art of Command
Obfuscate : The Art of Concealment
Protean : The Art of Shape-changing
Serpentis : The Art of the Serpent 
Vicissitude : The skill of flesh/bone crafting
Daimoinon : The Art of Demons 
Animalism : A vampires affinity towards animals and the BEAST

0 'ENCHANT WEAPON'~
Syntax: cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon>

~

Syntax: cast 'energy drain' <victim>

This spell saps the experience points, mana, and movement points of its
target.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).

~

0 ESCAPE~
This command allows you to transport to the temple of midgaard when

at recall...so be careful how you use it.

Syntax: look    <character>

~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

0 EXPERIENCE XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.

You gain experience by being part of a group that kills someone/something.

You lose experience by dying or being decapitated.

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your alignment versus your opponent's alignment; how 
many of this monster have been killed lately (if they are an NPC); and 
some random variation.

See also help on 'status' and 'statustable'
~

0 'FAERIE FIRE'~

This spell increases (makes worse) the armor class of its victim.
~

0 'FAERIE FOG'~
Syntax: cast 'faerie fog'

This spell reveals all manner of invisible, hidden, and sneaking creatures in
the same room as you.
~

0 FASTDRAW~
FASTDRAW is automatic, if you have it.  If another player attacks you 
while you have any sheathed weapons, you will draw them out with 
lightning speed and strike your opponent before they are able to land any 
blows on you.  If you have any items in your hands at the time, you will 
throw them aside before drawing your weapons.
~

0 FAVOUR SIRE PRINCE~
Syntax: favour <target> <sire/prince>

Favour is an ability available to second generation vampires and vampire 
princes.

SIRE allows the target vampire of your clan to sire another vampire.  
Once a single vampire has been created the power is lost, but can be 
granted again if the Antediluvian or Prince so desire.  A childe sired 
without permission is known as an Anarch.

PRINCE turns the target vampire into a prince, who is then able to allow 
other vampires the ability to sire more vampires still.  Only an 
Antediluvian has the power to make some a prince (or to remove the 
prince's powers).

ACCEPT will accept a childe into the clan, making them a Neonate.

INDUCT and OUTCAST will accept an Anarch into the clan or outcast a member.
~

0 FIGHT STYLE FIGHTSTYLE~
Syntax: fightstyle <number> <style>

This is used for unarmed combat, and it allows the fighter to decide on 
their style of unarmed attack.  Many different types of attack are 
possible, each with different advantages and disadvantages.  Your first 
attack in combat always uses the first number slot.  If you have a second 
attack, this will draw a fighting technique from slots 1 to 4.  If you 
have a third attack, it will draw a fighting technique from slots 5 to 
8.  Any other attacks are randomly drawn from any of slots 1 to 8.  If 
the slot is blank (0) then the attack is a standard unarmed attack.
~

4 'FIND FAMILIAR'~
Syntax: cast 'find familiar' <familiar>

This spell enables the caster to create a familiar, which can be either a 
frog, a raven, a cat, or a dog.  The mage is able to see everything that

~

0 FLAMESTRIKE~

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 FLY~
Syntax: cast 'fly' <character>

This spell enables the target character to fly.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>

SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
~

6 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>

             Read HELP CHANGES for new updates often as I post
             All changes to the code there no matter how small!

Enter thy Name my Dreamer:
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
~

0 GUARDIAN~

This spell summons a demonic guardian to aid the caster in combat (or 
just to show off to your friends ;).
~

-1 HAWK~

all the commands, spells, and skills listed in the game.
~

0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax: HIDE
Syntax: SNEAK
Syntax: VISIBLE

If you successfully HIDE, then other characters can't see you.  If you 
attack while hidden, the surprise attack will inflict one and a half 
times your normal damage (assuming your opponent cannot see you).

If you successfully SNEAK, then you can move in and out of rooms without
being noticed.

In order to HIDE or SNEAK successfully, you must practice the appropriate
skill.

VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 HIGHLANDER HIGHLANDERS~
Due to constant bitching and complaning about Highlanders, they have been
permanently removed from the game.

- Staff of MD
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.
~

4 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
~

0 HOME~
To set your recall point, enter the desired room and type 'home here'.  
From that point on you will recall to that point rather than the Temple 
of Midgaard (although you still go to the Templar Altar if you die).

A home cannot be a safe room.
~

11 HUNTERS~
Hunters are the people of the world who use their entire lives in        
searching and eliminating out all of the evil and supernatural beings    
that prevent humananity from surviving. Most of the beings think they    
are regular humans, but when they are faced by a fully-trained Hunter,   
the Hunter proves them completely wrong. As the hunter gets stronger,    
powers against the evil are granted to them by the Heralds of the        
Heavens. These powers are called Edges. With these edges, hunters will   
have it easier to throw out all of humanity's enemies around them, and   
leave humanity in serenity. Humans are not left with just Edges and      
without a weapon, the Heralds of the Heaven have granted strong Hunters  
the gunblade, a weapon that has malicious affects versus the enemies of  
the Hunter. As you might think that being one of the imbued is very      
simple as to just getting the Edges and gunblade. But, the mastering of  
being a hunter takes decades to accomplish with the almost impossible    
training. Most of the hunters that are in training either drop out from  
the stress and find another occupation less severe or don't even survive 
it. Beware, those who have mastered shall NOT in any way help you with   
your training, due to the Heralds of the Heavens getting angry. This is  
because they do not want a weak hunter on their hands, needing help to   
do everything, and give a bad name to Hunters. Hunters may also join a   
Sect of Hunters to group on the evil instead of fighting it solo.        
 
* Imbue      - Classing command for Hunters. (Gen 1&2 only) 
* Hunttalk   - Channel for Hunters to boast of their hunting accomplishments. 
* Ceremony   - Command for making Hunter eq. (requires 125 primal a piece)

* Sectexpel  - Command for expelling a hunter out of your sect. (Gen 2 only) 
* Edge       - Lists Edges available to you and your levels in them. 
* Research   - Begins your research in a particular Edge.

               research to your hunting abilities with train. 
 
There is a help file that explains the Edges of the Hunter. Type: 'help edges' 
 
~

0 HURL~
Syntax: hurl <name>
Syntax: hurl <name> <direction>

through doors.  Hurling someone through an exit does a little damage.

doors does three times as much.  If you don't specify a direction to hurl 
the target, it will be random (north, south, east or west).  You cannot

persist across reboots.

The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.

each hand. Its fingers have a reddish cast, the rest of the hand is
mauve. Mindflayers can communicate with all creatures via telepathy,

~

0 QUEST-TYPES~
The following are a few examples of quest types:
* Find the object/s.  Examples: Find 5 different coloured potions, Find a 
  pitch black longsword that flames brightly, Find a dragon dagger, belt 
  and bracer, etc.
* Kill the mob/s.  These can be hunt down and kill, or simple placing the 
  player in the same room as the mob/s.  Can also be combined with finding 
  objects - Example: Find and kill two different dragons and bring me 
  their claws.
* Solve a puzzle.  For example find a certain room, solve a riddle in an 
  area, or successfully get out of a maze.  These are particularly good 
  when several players of different ability are competing in the quest.
* Duel: A one-on-one fight pitting either a player against a mob, or 
  (more usually) a player against another player.  The conditions will be 
  decided beforehand, and can include any conditions that both sides 
  agree on.  Example: No sanctuary, no potions (or maybe a limited number),
  no spells, no weapons, or whatever.
* P-K Quest: Like a duel, but involves several players on either side.  
  Although the sides don't have to be equal in number, it is generally a 
  good idea to make sure they are roughly equal in power.
* There are also several more obscure quests that can be run - for 
  example you could require that the player brings you 3 small green 
  eggs, then load mob 30005 into the players room.  Another battle might 
  involve no melee - all combat must be with missile weapons.
~

0 QUESTCARD COMPLETE RECHARGE~
Syntax: complete card
Syntax: complete card <object>
Syntax: recharge card machine

A quest card requires 4 objects to complete.  To find out what 4 objects 
you need, type 'complete card'.  When you find these items, you should 
type 'complete card <object>'.  Once you have completed all 4 items on 
the card you will be told that you have completed the card.  Then you

'recharge card machine'.  You will receive a quest token reward, which 
you should eat, and the card will be recharged with 4 new items to find.

HINT:  Vallandar's tomb can be found by going 2 south, 7 east, 2 north 
from recall.  Once you have found that area, you should look for the 
guardian and solve his riddle, enter the portal he creates, and you'll be 
in the dark crypt.
~

0 QUESTING~
http://www.angelfire.com/nc/vampress
~

0 QUESTS~
Quest Makers (and occasionally higher levels) can set quests for one or 
more players to participate in.  The rewards for such quests can be in 
the form of specially modified equipment.  A number of quest points-worth 
will be allocated depending on the difficulty of the quest, using the 
following guidelines for point costs (QP's = Quest Points):

Stats (Str/Dex/Int/Wis/Con): 20 QP's per +1, max allowed is +3 per stat.
Hp/Mana/Move: 5 QP per +1, max allowed is +25 on each.
Hitroll/Damroll: 30 QP's per +1, max allowed is +5 on each.
Ac: 10 QP's per -1, max allowed is -25.

Once a certain affect (str, hitroll, ac, etc) is selected, it cannot be 
chosen again for that item even if you didn't select the maximum allowed 
amount.  Choosing to have penalties on an item will not decrease its 
cost, although some Quest Makers may allow extra points if you select a 
few disadvantages on the item.

For more information, type 'quest'.
~

0 QUESTSPELL~
Syntax: cast quest

~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be a mortal or avatar to
save.  The game will auto-save your character every few minutes whether you
save or not.

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

LEVEL 4 - DEVOUR - Hit point regen by devouring the corpses of slain enemies.

to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow

from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level 36 may not log in.  Players who lose their links, however,
may reconnect.
~

0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to God for miraculous transportation from where you are back to

regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

0 SORCERER SORC~
When a mage achieves the rank of Archmage they can then learn the ways of
Sorcery..  The benefits of being a Sorcerer give the mage some extended
powers and allows them to begin training for a magic specialization..

  * Once you are an archmage you must save up 5 million experience points
    and use the command 'soulbond'.
  * As a sorceror you may tie a grand sorceror for leadership of their
    colour
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bonus powers granted to a Sorcerer are as follows....
  
  * Stop -- This power allows you to stun your opponent but the potent 
            magic also does a minor amount of damage to the Sorcerer.
  * Planeshift -- This power allows the Sorcerer to walk the planes of 
                  magic to any player given that they have more mana
                  then their victim.
  * Solar Flare -- (Grand Sorcerer Only!) This power allows a Grand 
                   Sorcerer (or Clan Leader) to call upon the power of the
                   sun to strike down their foes-- Note this power also 
                   does considerable damage to the Sorcerer but well worth
                   the price.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(A Sorcerer can also train to become a Necromancer, an Illusionist, or an 
 Invoker.. please see HELP NECRO, HELP ILLUSIONIST, or HELP INVOKER.)

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you

confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
VIPER: A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

0 STATE~
There are 5 states of mind a Jedi must master. In combat use jstate to 
activate a single state. Each state gives a small damage and damage
reducer bonus, as well as allowing you to land a few extra attacks at
full (5) states.
~

0 STATUS~
This represents the 'danger' of the player.  You only have a status if 
you are level 3.  It grants no extra powers, but is a good measure of 
how deadly that player is in combat.  Each time you decapitate an 
Immortal or above, or an viable avatar you will gain 1 status point.
If you however cap an avatar without those stats, i.e an avatar with 1
or 0 pkills then you will be paradoxed.

0 Shapeshifter Shape Shifter ss~
Shapeshifters are constantly shape changing beings that are magical in
nature.  They have the ability to change form at will and assume the
talents of the creature they chose to shift in to.

To do this the shapeshifter must first seek out a creature and while
standing in front of it they type shift [creature].  After shifting
into that creature the shapeshifter would then type talents and see
what talents and emotions that creature had possessed.  If there were
any unlearned talents on the creature the shapeshifter would see the
talent's name then an equal sign (=) followed by a 0.  The shapeshifter
would then use that talent until the equal sign turned into an astrisk
(*).  All talents can go to 100.      

Being magical beings shapeshifters have the ability to train their
spell levels up to 295 in each color.  Also since being able to change
shape at will, they have become better at using their body attacks. 
These attacks include unarmed, claw, suck, and bite.    

* Shift - Shifts the shape into the form of a mob.
* Talents - Shows any new skills that can be learned from the
            currently shifted-into mob
* Sinduct - Induct a shape into your clan. (Must be Gen 1 or Gen 2)
* Sexpel - Outcasts a shape from your clan. (Must be Gen 1 or Gen 2)

~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

0 TIE UNTIE GAG BLINDFOLD~
Syntax: tie <target>
Syntax: untie <target>
Syntax: gag <target>
Syntax: blindfold <target>

TIE allows you yo tie up another player, who must be stunned, 
incapitated, or mortally wounded.  While tied up, a players actions are 
limited - they cannot move, quit, or do many other commands.

UNTIE will untie a player who is currently tied up.  A player cannot 
untie themself.

GAG places a gag over the mouth of the target player, who must first be 
tied up.  This command will also remove a gag.  A player can only remove 
a gag from themself if they are no longer tied up.  It is not possible 
to talk or use any of the channels while gagged.

BLINDFOLD places a blindfold over the eyes of the target player, who must 
first be tied up.  The blindfold can also be removed with this command.  
A player can only remove a blindfold from themself if they are no longer 
tied up.  Unsurprisingly, blindfolded players cannot see.
~

0 TITLE~
Syntax: title <string>

Sets your title to a given string.

The game supplies a title when your character is created.  You can use 
TITLE to set your title to something else. 
~

0 TOTEM TOTEMS~

spirits.  Each of the spirits teaches a different type of power, and the 
werewolf is able to gain use of these powers through the expenditure of 
primal energy.

* Bear   - Flex, Rage, Steel Claws, Hibernate, Quills, Roar, Skin,
           Slam.

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str/int/wis/dex/con>
Syntax: train <avatar/mortal/primal/hp/mana/move>
Syntax: train <slash/stab/smash/beast/grab>
Syntax: train <charm/heat/cold/lightning/acid/sleep/drain/voodoo>
Syntax: train <hurl/backstab/kick/steal/disarm>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class.  You can increase 
your attributes by spending experience points (exp) at a trainer.

It costs 200 exp to train a stat (str, int, etc), except that it costs 
only 100 exp to train your primary stat.  Primal costs 500 exp for the 
first point, 1000 for the second, 1500 for the third, etc, and 
hp/mana/move cost your current amount in that particular area minus your 
con (for hp and move) or wis (for mana) per point.  Becoming a mortal or 
an avatar costs 1000 exp each.

You can also train weapon resistances (reduces between 1 and all of the 
damage per blow for that weapon type), spell immunities (those types 
of spell do no damage to you), and skill immunities (they no long have 
any affect on you).  These cost 10000 exp for the first, 20000 for the 
second, 30000 for the third, and so on.
~

5 TRANSFER~
Syntax: transfer <character>
Syntax: transfer all
Syntax: transfer <character> <location>
Syntax: transfer all         <location>

TRANSFER transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location.
~

0 TRANSPORT~
Syntax: cast transport <object> <character>

This spell will transport the specified object from your inventory to 
that of the specified character.
~

8 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

6 USERS~
Syntax: users

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the channel
number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in merc.h:
0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

0 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES~
Vampires are the creatures of the night and thus take damage if exposed to
daylight.  Vampires cannot eat food, or drink any liquids except for blood.
If they cannot drink blood for a long duration of time they will start taking 
damage or maybe even go berserk, so it's a good idea to store some blood in
a drinking container.  Vampires take half damage from cold, none from gas,
and double from fire, although those with the Heat immunity take normal fire
damage rather than double.

Vampires use the power of their blood, known as #1DISCIPLINES#n and the
potency of their blood to fight enemies.  A vampires generation is a symbol
of how far from the first Vampire, Cain, he is.  The lower the generation
the larger blood pool and the harder to destroy (higher parry/dodge) a
vampire is.  The most powerful are those of the Methuselah Founders.
Training AGE is very important to a vampires power.

A vampires existance is in constant struggle with the #1BEAST#n. There
are those who leash the beast and have reached #1GOLCONDA#n, a great sense
of peace.  However others release the #1BEAST#n and become vampires of
pure destruction, ready to destroy the country side.  Yet a vampire can
appease his beast with a ritual of #1BEASTDOWN#n, lowering the beast at
the cost of the energy the vampire has gained. To those fortunate golconda
vampires they are able to act the right of #1DAYWALKER#n and become
invulnerable to sun damage

The VAMPALLOW command toggles on/off whether vampires may bite/feed you.

**For now vamps start with beast at 0, but you do not get benifits from
  golconda. However you can still train #1DAYWALKER#n to gain immunity
  from sunlight.

0 VENTRILOQUATE~
Syntax: cast ventriloquate <speaker> <message>

This spell throws your voice, making it appear that some other object or
character in the room is saying your message.  Victims who make their saving
throw will know that someone is using ventriloquism, but not who.  Victims who
fail their saving throw will think that the object or character really did say
your message.

0 VOODOO~
Syntax: Spell:   cast voodoo <victim>
        Ability: voodoo <victim> <action>

Voodoo magic allows the caster to do things to another player indirectly.
First, a body part of the victim is needed.  The caster should hold this 
part and cast the spell on the target (they don't have to be in the same 
room).  This will create the voodoo doll, which the caster the voodoo 
commands on to interfere with the victim.
There are three voodoo actions.  The first, 'Stab', is only of use as a 
warning to the victim, or to cause annoyance.  The second, 'Throw', will 
hurl the victim from their feet and cause a small amount of damage.  The 
third and final action, 'Burn', will set the victim on fire, as well as 
destroy the doll itself.
~

0 WEAKEN~
Syntax: cast weaken <victim>

This spell reduces the strength of the victim by two points.
~

0 WEREWOLF WEREWOLVES~
At the beginning of things, Gaia - the world and the spirit that embodies 
it - set all things in a balance that would maintain and encourage life.  
Near the top of this chain of being was humanity, and above them were the 
Garou - the sacred warriors of the spirit.  They were appointed to be the 
crusaders against the Wyrm, who spreads its cancer through the humans.  
They are the preservers of the raw essence of life, of nature's diversity 
and purity.  They are the Earth's immune system, fighting the disease of 
the Wyrm.  They are the werewolves, and they fight and destroy the 
children of the Wyrm (such as the vampires) at every opportunity.

powers.  For more information, type 'help totems'.
