Look..As much fun as this place is...I (this is just an oppinion, it is YOUR mud after all, and you can do with it what you please) just think you guys are focusing too much effort onto adding new classes and features than you are on fixing what's broken.

I mean..Half the classes are almost 'unplayable' being that even with first, and full priceless, anything less than a gen1 dies easialy.  When I was Jedi, I had near full priceless (missing about 3 pieces) and a mage blest at most times.  The ONLY class in the entire mud I stood HALF a chance against was demon, and demon (except for again, the gen1, Fluex) dies to about everything anyways

Jedi can barely kill anything...Demon barely can, there are almost no good golems (blame this on lack of class knowledge, skill, or whatever), almost no good amazons/slaves (maybe the same problem as golems? skill? or that they're too weak in general), and few good monks, or werewolves.

On the other end, shapes, drow, ninja, and vampires can easily beat most classes in the mud if they are genuinely maxed, trained, and quested.

These are just my thoughts on the direction of the mud, you can even ignore them if you wish.  I just felt a need to leave a comment is all.

Found a small problem, not sure if it was spefically changed or not
i know before the big crasjh if a player had
more mana than a shape, he or she could see the shape
but now, i have noticed no matter how much more mana than a shape i have
i can no longer see the shape
it might be cause im a ninja, and before i was a monk
just wanted to know why...
thanx for your time

Subject player deletion~
Text
agravaine deleted yesterday cause he got pissed over losing his artis
he did this willingly, knowing the consequences.
any other player would have to deal with it, so i think he should to
he's not gettinga  reimburse, nor is his old pfile gonna be restored.
this wouldn't be fair to the others
and it also isn't fair given agravaine's shitty attitude the past few weeks

Text
monkeespyder lost eq, he didn't say due to what, but i assume a crash
he asked for a reimburse and bree and i were ready to do that
then monkee whines that he lost his eq due to an imm and now he has to remake it
i don't have any backup pfiles (today 7/5/2000 is the only backups i have)
monkee didn't note anyone so i erased the pfiles that i had from 6/27 today when i made the backup
no one reimburse monkee, let bree and i handle this when he stops being so angry over having to remake eq
