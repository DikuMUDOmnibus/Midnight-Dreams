you will notice the .mod was added to the zip name, if this is an original
distribution. That is because bryantos didn't give me (smoo) a chance to
do any final things before the mud went down. I have made the zip size
smaller by removing a few executables, and have also appended the license,
warning, and made this file and the one explaining how to start the mud
up. I have also put up some explinations next to some of my code.

Have fun
