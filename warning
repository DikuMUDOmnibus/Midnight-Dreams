THIS CODE IS BUGGY TO SHIT USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. If you wanna 
debug it you can check out crash.txt in area folder it logs last thing
to happen when the mud crashes sorta like a signal handler ya know.
anyways Please dont go bugging me for help about bugs. if there not 
fixed now I dont know how. Sell and desc and note with alot of colors
are bugged there easy fixes I was to lazy to get around to it. If you 
want you can fix arena all I think it lacked was a arena that had the 
vnums we put anyways..... HAVE FUN!!!!!

Its not really that buggy, we just had a lot of disabled shit because we
everyone thought they were bugged when they weren't, I don't think sell is
bugged but it might be .. desc and note can be easily fixed by stuffing in
a bash_color(argument); at the start of the commands, anyways, the arena
shouldn't even be much work but I quit mudding so have fun fixing them
yourselves

if crash.txt says it wasn't a pfile and it wasn't a command that crashed
the mud, its a memory error or something in update.c or something like
that
